# Quick Hack (Snowplow data to train VW)

This is a very quick PoC during KDD 2018 to try the contextual bandits presented [here][contextual-bandit].

The idea is that I am reading the enriched event stream of [snwoplow][snowplow] Near Real-Time pipeline, which contain a new iglu context (as of yet uncommitted) that contains the vw_label data (this is a quick hack).

It then picks any other fields from the enriched event or any context (or other self-describing field) using the [snowplow python SDK][snowplow-python-sdk] and pipes it to the vw image built with this [vw-docker][vw-docker]
which then in turn spits out model data.

Here is an example training a [bandit][bandit]. The output can then be used to present one of the alternatives to show to the user, like so:

```bash
pip install snowplow_analytics_sdk==0.2.3
cat sample-snowplow-data/part-00057-09103e46-8f45-49ba-a1bc-26a869e69633-c000.csv | python fwozen_wabbit.py user_ipaddress v_etl | docker run -i vowpal-wabbit:master --cb 4 --cb_type ips
```
